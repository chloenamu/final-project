Project: Take medicine properly app

1.Background 
People are having a busy life style and it is easy to forget when or how to take their medicine, especially when they are taking many different pills in a day. From my work experiences, I have seen that many patients have difficulties with their medication use, due to the complexity or lack of information regarding their health condition or medicine. By using this application, people can optimize the benefit of their medicine or health supplement and learn how to manage their health. 

2.Functionality 
•	Make a list of your daily medicine by adding and removing the items

•	Set alarm for the time to take medications
>>> tried coding in JavaScript with setTimeout, but failed it. 
>>> show the alarm function by just changing the background color and alert signal. 

•	Suggest how to take or what to avoid with their medicine
>>> linked to the website of drug information, but would be much better if this app can be provided information by api method from other resources (how?)
